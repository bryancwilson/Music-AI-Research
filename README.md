# Music-AI-Research
 
This github repository serves as my portfolio of my independent undergraduate research from May 2021 to August 2022. I want to give a huge thank you to the 
to the professors and graduate students at NC State University for their mentorship and guidance. I have listed them below... 

Summer 2021
  Dr. John-Paul Ore (Professor in the Dept. of Computer Science at NC State University)

Summer 2022
  Dr. Thomas Price (Professor in the Dept. of Computer Science at NC State University)
  Jimmy Skripchuck (Computer Science PhD Student at NC State University)

During both Summer 2021 and Summer 2022, I conducted research through the Women and Minority Summer Research headed by Dr. Javon Adams (Interim Director of the 
College of Engineering Women and Minority Engineering Programs at NC State University).

Abstract
The creation of original music through Artificial Intelligence is not a novel idea. In fact, conceptions of musical automata and automatic music machines are centuries old. 
Due to the seemingly infeasible task of generalizing and quantifying musical structure (harmonic, melodic, and rhythmic structure), researchers have trained their AI algorithms on a dataset
of sheet music using generative supervised Learning. Because the purpose of generative supervised learning is to synthesize new creations based on any given dataset, this approach 
blinds the AI architecture from musical possibilities outside the dataset, thus limiting its originality. The purpose of this study is to broaden the musical possibilities an AI algorithm can 
choose from by instead training a reinforcement learning model through a musical ‘rubric’. Instead of looking to create a sufficient and comprehensive 
reward structure based on the entirety of music, the researcher constructed a reward structure quantified on a much smaller musical structure based entirely on diatonic jazz harmony. This 
reward structure will be used to train the reinforcement learning model. It is expected that by taking this approach, the reinforcement learning model will synthesize music at 
a higher level of originality then that of generative supervised learning models.
